# rgat
An instruction trace visualisation tool for speedy reverse engineering

#Introduction

RGAT uses dynamic binary instrumentation to produce graphs from running executables. 
It produces graph visualisations in realtime to support analysis of binaries that might be a lot more cumbersome with 
disassemblers and debuggers alone.

##Examples

Essentially proposing to do follow on work to Chapter 5 of the Valgrind PhD thesis (Nethercote, Nicholas, and Alan Mycroft. "Redux: A dynamic dataflow tracer." Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 89.2 (2003): 149-170.)
