# rgat
An instruction trace visualisation tool for speedy reverse engineering

#Introduction

RGAT uses dynamic binary instrumentation to produce graphs from running executables. 
It produces graph visualisations in realtime to support analysis of binaries that might be a lot more cumbersome with 
disassemblers and debuggers alone.
